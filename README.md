#Jobs: A Marionette Tutorial

Jobs is a tutorial about Derick Bailey's amazing [Marionette](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette) framework which sits on top of [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).  The goal of the tutorial is to show how Marionette works through a simple application that displays information located in a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) file.
